## Background 

In this project, we will explore earthquakes around the world in the past 24 hrs based on their magnitude, location, and data. We will map these on a world map using leaflet and mapbox. 

### Tasks 

1. Get your data set

2. Import & Visualize the Data

     <ul> Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and                   latitude. </ul>

     <ul> Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes               should appear larger and darker in color. </ul>

     <ul> Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. </ul>

     <ul> Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.  </ul>
